This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and trying to run an app that uses a library which is not compatible with the Expo managed workflow.  The error message often mentions something about a module not being found or a runtime error related to a specific library. For example, you might get an error if trying to use a library that directly interacts with native modules without the necessary Expo compatibility layer. This could involve libraries that use native code, or those that need to access low-level features of the device that aren't easily available within Expo's sandboxed environment.
