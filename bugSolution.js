The solution depends on the specific library causing the issue.  Here are some strategies:

1. **Find an Expo-compatible alternative:** Search for similar libraries that are explicitly designed to work with Expo.  Expo's documentation and the community forums are great resources for finding alternatives.
2. **Use the Expo bare workflow:** If an Expo-compatible alternative isn't available and the library is crucial, you may switch to the Expo bare workflow. This gives you more control over native modules, but comes with increased complexity.
3. **Adapt the library:** In some cases, the library might be adaptable to work within the Expo managed workflow.  This might require careful review of the library's code and modifications to make it compatible with Expo's environment.  This is often the most challenging approach.

**Example (Illustrative):**

The following code shows a hypothetical solution where an Expo-compatible alternative, `expo-uncommon-module`, replaces the problematic library.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import { uncommonFunction } from 'expo-uncommon-module'; // Expo-compatible alternative

export default function App() {
  const result = uncommonFunction();
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{result}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
